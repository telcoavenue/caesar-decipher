# caesar-decipher

deciphers a three step forward caesar ciphered text into it original non ciphered state.

For example:

In latin alphabet, the letter A will appear as letter D, if ciphered .

By applying the three step forward caesar decipher, the cipher text will
return to it original state.

In essence, the ciphered letter D will give it place, to the letter of origin, which is the latin letter A.
